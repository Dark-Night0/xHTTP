# xHTTP
This is the implementation in a single C file of an embeddable HTTP server.

I'm building this to have an easy way to create HTTP services for my personal projects. The main idea is that for most basic purposes big web servers aren't necessary and a single C file of well-tested routines can do the job.

**NOTE**: Since it's my first time building something of this kind, it's still in an early sperimentation phase.
